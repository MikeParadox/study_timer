# Study Scheduler

    Before a user will be able to work in an app he or she should create an
    account(maybe not for the timer, just for the rest of functionality)

    Then the user can create a curriculum - some subjects he want to learn. The optional part is to set deadline for the whole curriculum or different deadlines for the different subjects. There should be(optional) explicit structure for each subject customization(topics, midterm goals and so on).
    To be continued...

    Next part is the scheduller itself. We can use one of the learning algorithms for learning(periodic repetitions and so on) which will tell the user what to learn now, what to repeat today and so on. 
    To be continued...

    Also there can be some visualised statistics(how much the user learn a day, a month with separation on subject available). 

    The last part has just come to me - in the end, when some times go by, and we become better developers we will be able to create some predefined recommendations on subjects we're learning now(mostly programming I consider). I can't say in your behave but for me sometimes it's the problem what to learn now, what book to read now and so on. So we will be able to help other people to learn how to become a devs using our shared experience. But it's quite raw idea for the time we'll have nothing to implement left.
